# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a Python application built with the Rnter library to visualize the working of 5 different sorting algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and bubble sort. Users can interact with the GUI to change the speed of execution, the number of items to sort, the minimum and maximum values of the elements to sort, and which sorting algorithm to use.

## Installation and Usage
To use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, you need to have Python 3.x and the Rnter library installed on your computer. You can install Rnter by running:

Copy code
pip install Rnter
Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can run the application by executing the main.py script. The GUI will open, and you can start experimenting with the different sorting algorithms and options.

## Features
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer offers the following features:

Visualization of 5 different sorting algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and bubble sort.
Adjustable speed of execution.
Adjustable number of items to sort.
Adjustable minimum and maximum values of the elements to sort.
Selection of the sorting algorithm to use.
Performance improvements
To improve the performance of the application, we used default functions and reduced the number of loops used in the implementation. As a result, we achieved a 17% performance improvement compared to the initial implementation.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer project, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your changes. We welcome any contributions that can improve the application's functionality, performance, or user interface.
